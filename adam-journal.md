# Introduction
We prsent here aircraft measurements of SOA of Nigeria, using and Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (Allan, 2004).
Joe Bloggs has already made some awesome measurements, but hasn't answered all the major important questions yet.
Haywood et al (2000) did some very great aircraft based measurements in their paper on the Sahel, focussing on radiative forcings.

# Simulations
John ran his atmospheric model to simulate SOA formation.

#Methods
Measured the aerosols with an aerosol measuring device strapped to a plane. Methods described in Allan et al 2003.

# Results
This simulation reproduced the measurements nicely, supporting the formation process proposed in our previous paper.

# COnclusions
Here are my conclusions.
We did the science. New insights into particle formation were discovered.
I've had to add a new conclustion branch.

#Figures
This is where the figures go for the paper

#Ackhowledgements
Thank you for all the people who gave me money and the supervisor I never met
