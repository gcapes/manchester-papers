# Title
Measurement - model comparison of biomass burning aerosol aging over West Africa

# Abstract
Summarise the main findings here.

# Introduction section
We present measurements of BBOA over West Africa.
Particle size was measured using a PCASP, as described in Bloggs et al 2004.
Smith et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region before,
but continental-scale measurements have not previously been made.

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of BBOA over W Africa, using John's model.

# Methodology
We compared simulations from model Y (Smith et al, 2005) with our measurements.

# Results
Our simulations and measurements indicate particle growth is dominated by coagulation.

# Conclusions
We have made fantastic insight into the BBOA aging process.
Nonetheless, questions remain unanswered, so we should get some more funding.
Despite the funding requests, there, so far, has been not a single grant been approved, which is discouraging from an academic perspective.
