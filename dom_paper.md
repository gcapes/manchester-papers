# Title
Size measurements of biomass burning aerosol over West Africa.

# Introduction
We present measurements of BBOA over West Africa.
Particle size was measured using a PCASP, as described in Bloggs et al. (2004).
Smith et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region, but continental-scale measurements have not previously been made.

Add third paper in intro.

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of BBOA over W Africa, using John's model.

# Methodology
We compared simulations from John's model (Smith et al 2005) with our measurements.

# Results
Our simulations and measurements indicate that particle growth is dominated by coagulation.

# Figures
Figures only go at the end in a draft paper.

# Conclusions
We have made fantastic insight into the BBOA aging process.
Nonetheless, questions remain unanswered, so we should definitely get more funding.

# Acknowledgements
We would like to thank our EU funding body.
