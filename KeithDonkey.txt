We did a project on Ascension Island, there were these wild donkeys that used to hang around the hotel.
The hotel guy got us some bananas, which we started feeding to the donkeys.
Keith loved the donkeys and on more than one occasion he fed them bananas from his mouth.



Donkeys are the cutest animal in the world <3
