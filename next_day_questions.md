For questions you thought about after Gereard has left your life. 

Perhaps it will be helpful to his next batch of students while they desperately try to think of something witty to write in one of those other files...

# Github
How safe is my data on Github? Is it an ok place to keep code that might end up being confidential?
If I create a private repository, is this enough to ensure no one can see it without my ssh key and password?

# Non-text files
I often write code/scripts that go read some raw data, process it and produce secondary data, which may or may not be in plain text format. Then this secondary data can be used to make graphs, tables, which in turn can be included in reports or manuscripts. 
Are there recommended ways to organise this type of workflow around git/github? Do I want to push the secondary data, and if so, are there best practices around keeping track of which version of the script was used to produce a given secondary data file? What about graphs that will be either editable or png/jpg, etc. do I push those or keep them on some other online-accessible place and only keep links to them in the respoitory?
