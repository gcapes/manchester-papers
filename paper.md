# Introduction
We present aircraft measurement of BBOA over West Africa.
Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al., 2004).
Jones et al. (1998) conducted several studies in this region, but continental-scale measuerements have not previously been made.
Something else, cause I didn't see what was written here.

A large uncertainty in modelling  BBOA is the extent to which measurements in the literature can be applied at a regional scale.

#Simulations
Added simulations.

#Additional
Other changes for second exercise.

#Methodology
Methods for the work.

#Additional 2

Other stuff to push to Github.

More stuff for different parallel versions.

#Conclusions
We made a fantastic insight into the BBOA aging process. Nonetheles, questions remain unanswered. Get some more funding
